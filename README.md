## Summary
The purpose of this homework assignment was to develop a web design skeleton. I made several elements in the HTML but the bulk of the work was done in the style.css folder.

## HTML
I structured my HTML to have several sections like a header, nav, section, aside, article, and footer.
## CSS
Here I specify the properties of my selectors to change their values. I made values lilke padding, text-align, background, etc.
